### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionated by Physics with a strong enthusiasm for the fundations of Quantum Mechanics and its applications in the new era of technology, wishing to understand someday what is $\psi$. Nevertheless, I'm also curious about other areas of physics like High Energy, Quantum Gravity or Complex Systems, even other topics like psicology or phylosophy.

I have a solid background in programming languages like [Python](https://www.python.org/) and most of its common libraries for scientits (numpy, matplotlib) and data science (pandas). Also experienced in web applications (html, javascript, ReactJS, CSS...) and SQL management with [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/). Awarded with a [Developer Certification in Android Development with Java](http://bcert.me/sglpcwce) and interested in promissing languages like [Julia](https://julialang.org/).

Firm defendant of [Open Source in Science and Technology](https://archive.org/stream/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/Goamjuly2008_djvu.txt).
